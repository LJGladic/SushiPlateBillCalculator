# SushiPlateBillCalculator
### An Android app to calculate the total bill based on number of plates ordered from a rotary sushi bar.
The main view (currently the only view) has 5 rows by default.  The rows simply multiply the user inputted cost by the user inputted number of plates.  It will sum the total for each row and add into the total for all the rows and display it.  There are buttons on the sides of the plate input region that allow the user to add or remove 1 from the number of plates.

The user can also add or remove rows (the current max number of rows is 10, but that can easily be changed in the future).
